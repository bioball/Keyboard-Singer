Keyboard-Singer
===============

Sing harmony with yourself! Press down the corresponding keys to hear your voice, pitch mapped (and minion sounding to boot).

This project uses Peter Hayes' [pitchfinder library](https://github.com/peterkhayes/pitchfinder.js), and a custom hacky pitch shifting algorithm.
